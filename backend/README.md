# Backend (NestJS scaffold)

This folder contains a minimal NestJS-style scaffold for the SaaS platform backend.

Quick start (from `backend`):

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run in dev: `npm run start:dev`
3. Build: `npm run build` then `npm start`

Swagger UI available at `http://localhost:3000/api/docs` when running.

Notes:
- Services and auth are stubbed and intended as a starting point.
- Add DB entities, TypeORM config and real auth logic next.
